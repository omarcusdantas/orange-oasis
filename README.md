## :speech_balloon: Description
This project contains the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images and JSON files for a fictional e-commerce called Orange Oasis. The application uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons/) to enhance the user experience and provide a range of helpful features.

It features Home, Products, About, Contact, and Cart pages for the user to navigate. Users can browse products in the Home or Products page, choose a quantity and size, and add items to their cart with ease. The Cart page allows users to view their current cart, adjust quantities, and exclude items as needed.
